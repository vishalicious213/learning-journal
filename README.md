# Learning Journal

This was a Scrimba solo project that completed Module 6: Responsive Design in the Frontend Developer's Path. We were given a Figma design and had to build a blog site / learning journal. The requirements were to build each page from scratch, make all pages responsive, use relative units, employ mobile-first design, media queries and the viewport meta tag. The Figma design included photo assets and other design information, such as fonts, sizing and spacing of elements, color information and so on.
