            <h1 id="about-h1">Hi there! My name is Vish and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
            <p class="about-txt">This website is the solo project for Module 6 (Responsive Design) of Scrimba's Frontend Developer's Path. At the end of Module 6, famous internet CSS guru Kevin Powell walks us through CSS Grid, and we're supposed to use knowledge of the Grid, along with other responsive design techniques, to build out the learning journal that you now behold with your very own eyes.</p>
            <p class="about-txt">The requirements for this project were to build each page from scratch, make all pages responsive, use relative units, mobile-first design, media queries and the viewport meta tag. We're given a Figma design from which to base the site on. It includes photo assets, although I replaced poor Roku's name and face with my own, to both horror and delight the unfortunate visitor to this page.</p>
            <p class="about-txt">I looked at implementations of the project from other Scrimba students and was surprised to see that the majority of them built out static pages for every page on the site, and didn't make use of CSS Grid when they built out the project. I took a modular and more programmatic approach than static HTML pages, to make myself use JavaScript where I could, both to test my JavaScript ability as well as make the code as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as I could.</p>
            <p class="about-txt">The article/blog post pages have their content rendered using a JavaScript function that reads HTML from an array of objects. Because this project uses vanilla JavaScript instead of a library or framework like React, Vue or Angular, I relied on updating the innerHTML of various elements and styling them from a CSS file. Some libraries, like React, combine these processes into the same functions and even allow for CSS-in-JS, which is a method that I enjoy. Building the site in the manner in which I did does help with understanding what's happening behind-the-scenes using tools like React and gives me a greater appreciation for the complexity of their abstraction of the JavaScript through JSX, however.</p>
